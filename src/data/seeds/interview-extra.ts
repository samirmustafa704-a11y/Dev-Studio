    question: "What is Angular's component lifecycle and name the key hooks?",
    answer:
      "Angular components go through: ngOnChanges (input changes), ngOnInit (after first change detection), ngDoCheck, ngAfterContentInit, ngAfterContentChecked, ngAfterViewInit, ngAfterViewChecked, ngOnDestroy. Most commonly used: ngOnInit (setup), ngOnDestroy (cleanup subscriptions), ngOnChanges (react to @Input changes).",

    question: "How does Angular's dependency injection system work?",
    answer:
      "Angular has a hierarchical DI system. Services are registered in providers (root injector, module injector, or component injector). When a component requests a service via constructor injection, Angular walks up the injector tree to find a provider. `providedIn: 'root'` makes a service a singleton app-wide. Component-level providers create a new instance per component subtree.",

    answer:
      "Default: Angular checks the entire component tree on every event/async operation (slow for large apps). OnPush: Angular only checks when 1) an @Input reference changes (immutable data), 2) an event originates from the component or its children, 3) async pipe emits, or 4) markForCheck() is called manually. OnPush requires immutable data patterns and delivers significant performance gains.",

Simpler than RxJS for synchronous state: `const count = signal(0); count.set(1); count.update(v => v+1); computed(() => count() * 2)`.

In the router: `loadChildren: () => import('./feature/feature.module').then(m => m.FeatureModule)` or with standalone components: `loadComponent: () => import('./feature.component')`.

Reactive: form structure defined in component class (FormControl, FormGroup, FormArray), synchronous access to form tree, fully testable, better for complex dynamic forms.

    question: "What is an ORM and what are its tradeoffs?",
    answer:
      "ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) maps database tables to classes/objects, enabling type-safe queries without raw SQL. Benefits: productivity, portability across DBs, migrations tooling, avoids SQL injection by default. Tradeoffs: N+1 query problem if eager loading not configured, generated SQL can be inefficient (use EXPLAIN to verify), abstraction leaks in complex queries, heavy reflection overhead. Solution: use ORM for standard CRUD, raw SQL / query builders for complex queries.",

    question: "What is database denormalization and when is it justified?",
    answer:
      "Denormalization intentionally introduces redundancy (duplicating data, pre-computed aggregates) to speed up reads at the cost of write complexity and storage. Justified when: read performance is critical and joins are too slow, the data is mostly read-only, you need to support analytics queries on OLTP data, or building read models for CQRS. Examples: storing user name on orders table, pre-computed order totals. Always measure before denormalizing — premature optimization.",

    answer:

Current state is derived by replaying events. Benefits: complete audit log, ability to rebuild state at any point, decoupled event consumers. Tradeoffs: complex queries (need projections/read models), eventual consistency, snapshot management for long event histories. Usually paired with CQRS.",

      "What is the difference between optimistic and pessimistic concurrency control in databases?",
    answer:
      "Pessimistic: acquire a lock before reading/writing (SELECT FOR UPDATE). Blocks concurrent access — safe but reduces throughput. Use for high-contention scenarios like inventory deduction. Optimistic: read without lock, write with a version check (WHERE version = :expected). If version changed, abort and retry. Better throughput when conflicts are rare — common in web apps. Both prevent lost updates. Optimistic is the ORM default (version column).",

Unique index: enforces uniqueness on one or more columns, can allow NULLs (multiple NULLs are allowed in most DBs since NULL ≠ NULL), multiple unique indexes per table, used for business-level uniqueness constraints (email, username).

    answer:
      "A connection pool maintains a set of pre-established connections reused across requests. Opening a DB connection is expensive (TCP handshake, auth, SSL). Without pooling, each request opens/closes a connection — at scale you hit DB connection limits. Sizing rule of thumb: pool_size = num_cores × 2 + effective_spindle_count (HDD) or just CPU cores × 2 for SSD. Use PgBouncer for Postgres in transaction mode. Monitor: pool exhaustion (requests queuing) = increase pool or reduce query time.",

It allows defining policies (using SQL) that restrict which rows a user can SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.

    question: "What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?",
    answer:
      "`==` performs type coercion before comparing, so `'5' == 5` is `true`. `===` (strict equality) compares both value AND type without coercion, so `'5' === 5` is `false`. Always prefer `===` to avoid subtle bugs.",

It assumes elements of different types produce different trees; uses `key` to identify list items across renders. Minimal patches are applied to the real DOM.",

A mismatch occurs when the client-rendered output differs from the server HTML (e.g., using `Date.now()` or `window` on server). Mismatches cause React to re-render the entire tree client-side, defeating SSR performance benefits.
